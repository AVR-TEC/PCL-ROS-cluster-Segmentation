### ROS Node for Cluster Based Segmentation with PCL
---

`Python` `ROS` node for image segmentation on a cluttered environment with cluster based methods. Tested in simulation environment provided at https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Exercises.git. Node sensor input is `ROS` msg `PointCloud2` generated in `Gazebo` simulation environment from RGBD camera. `pcl_helper.py` lib provided for `ROS` `PointCloud2` msg to PCL data structure conversions.

`ROS` node `segmentation.py` in /scripts directory.
